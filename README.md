Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages.

Python is an interpreted language. This means that a new executable file is created when you run your code.
The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

Python is constantly growing in the market. With Python knowledge, I may find myself in top positions within a few years, but I should increase my knowledge as much as possible. 

There are various job fields that Python has to offer. Integrating applications with MySQL is in high demand because MySQL and Python are both open-source applications.

Comments could be used for a wide range of purposes, for example: 

Augmenting program code with basic descriptions to generate external documentation.
Integration with source code management systems and other kinds of external programming tools.

Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line.

In [1] : the_world_is_flat = true
if the_world_is_flat:
  print("Be careful not to fall off!")

# this is the first comment
span = 1 # amd this is the second comment
         # ... and now a third
text = "# This is not a correct because it's inside quotes."
